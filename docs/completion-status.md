# AIal Codebase Completion Review

## Overview
This document captures the current implementation status of the AIal monorepo based on the source tree as of this review. It highlights what is already in place, what remains partially implemented, and the gaps that must be closed for a production-ready release.

## Implemented Components
- **HTTP daemon skeleton** – The Node.js server wires up the router, exposes REST endpoints for chat, completions, responses, raw passthrough, and health checks, and performs basic request/response shaping. It also conditionally starts the gRPC facade. 【F:packages/daemon/src/server.js†L1-L292】【F:packages/daemon/src/grpc.js†L1-L101】
- **Provider adapters** – Concrete adapters exist for OpenAI, Google Gemini, xAI Grok, and Anthropic. Each normalises model IDs and issues provider-specific REST calls when credentials are supplied, otherwise the system falls back to the development echo adapter. 【F:packages/router-core/src/index.js†L1-L43】【F:packages/router-core/src/adapters/openai.js†L1-L72】【F:packages/router-core/src/adapters/gemini.js†L1-L57】【F:packages/router-core/src/adapters/grok.js†L1-L63】【F:packages/router-core/src/adapters/anthropic.js†L1-L82】
- **Public surface descriptions** – The project already ships an OpenAPI contract, gRPC proto, and top-level README that describe the intended functionality and deployment story. 【F:openapi/openapi.yaml†L1-L118】【F:proto/chat.proto†L1-L21】【F:README.md†L1-L77】

## Partially Implemented / Non-Functional Areas
- **Build & packaging pipeline** – Workspace build scripts are placeholders and the Docker image expects precompiled outputs under `packages/*/dist`, which do not exist. Attempting to run the container will therefore fail. 【F:packages/router-core/package.json†L1-L12】【F:packages/daemon/package.json†L1-L13】【F:Dockerfile†L1-L19】
- **Streaming semantics** – The HTTP `/v1/chat.stream` and gRPC `ChatStream` routes wrap the synchronous router response rather than streaming incremental tokens, so real-time delivery is not implemented. 【F:packages/daemon/src/server.js†L205-L217】【F:packages/daemon/src/grpc.js†L64-L80】
- **Usage telemetry** – Responses currently hard-code token usage fields to zero, indicating metering has not been integrated yet. 【F:packages/daemon/src/server.js†L122-L157】

## Missing or Incomplete Features
- **Authentication & key management** – Despite the README documenting a master key requirement, the server does not validate `Authorization` headers or handle key management, leaving the API unauthenticated. 【F:README.md†L40-L59】【F:packages/daemon/src/server.js†L182-L268】
- **Error resilience & retries** – Provider adapters directly surface `fetch` failures without retry logic, timeout controls, or structured error mapping, which is needed for production stability. 【F:packages/router-core/src/adapters/openai.js†L31-L70】【F:packages/router-core/src/adapters/gemini.js†L16-L57】【F:packages/router-core/src/adapters/grok.js†L31-L63】【F:packages/router-core/src/adapters/anthropic.js†L33-L82】
- **Testing & quality gates** – There are no automated tests, linters, or CI workflows in the repository. Even `npm test` prints "no tests yet", signalling that validation coverage has not begun. 【F:packages/router-core/package.json†L1-L12】
- **Security hardening** – Input validation, rate limiting, request size caps, and logging scrubbing are absent, which must be addressed before exposing the service publicly. 【F:packages/daemon/src/server.js†L182-L268】

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Implement real build steps for each workspace (TypeScript compilation or bundling) and update the Dockerfile to copy the generated artefacts so container runs succeed.
2. Enforce authentication/authorisation in the HTTP and gRPC layers, wired to the documented master key and provider credential model.
3. Replace the fake streaming responses with genuine incremental delivery from provider SDKs, or clearly scope streaming out of the MVP.
4. Add unit and integration tests around the router, adapters, and HTTP handlers, and configure CI to run them.
5. Layer in observability (structured logs, metrics), usage accounting, and defensive controls (timeouts, retries, input validation) required for operating the service in production.
